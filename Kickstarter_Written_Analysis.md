# Project Name: Kickstarting with Excel
###By Atlantys Royel


## Overview of Project

Case: Compare the outcome of fundraising campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. 

Goals: 
- Analyze fundraising outcomes based on launch date.
- Analyze fundraising outcomes based on goal amount. 

Deliverables: 
- Create a pivot table of outcomes based on launch date.
- Create a line graph of outcomes based on goals. 


### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create visual representations of fundraising data to provide insight on fundraising outcomes to help fundraisers design successful campaigns. While some campaigns lead to a successful outcome of meeting the fundraising goal, others do not. This project will compare the outcomes of fundraising campaigns based on the goal amount and launch date of the campaign. This analysis will be accomplished using Microsoft Excel by Feburary 28, 2022. 

### Analysis and Challenges

This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel to clean, organize, and visualize the data. There were no challenges to perform this analysis. Possible challenges that could be encountered in this style of analysis are the inability to verify the accuracy of each cell prior to making visualizations. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The analysis of fundraising outcomes based on launch date began with the conversion of unix timestamps into a readable date format. Then, a pivot table could be generated with the correct fields, including date and outcome. To further visualize the data, a pivot chart was created, showing the outcomes (cancelled, failed, and successful) as lines in a graph. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The analysis of fundraising outcomes based on goal began by sorting the data based on financial goal of the campaign and the outcome, i.e. successful, failed, or cancelled. Once sorted and counted, the data was visualized using a line graph.


### Results

####What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. Most successful campaigns are launched in May or June.
2. Successful campaigns decline leading up to and during the holiday months. 

####What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. The highest percentage of successful campaigns have a goal of less than 1000.
2. The highest number of failed campaigns have a goal between $10,000 to $14,999. This is unexpected because if the most successful campaigns are in the lowest goal range, you would expect the most failed campaigns to be in the highest goal range. 

####What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset could contain profit numbers, if available, to comprehensively evaluate the success of the campaign and project. This would be an interesting addition to the dataset to determine if a higher goal amount during fundraising guaranteed success of the project, overall. 

####What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- outcome based on pledged amount
- outcome based on  number of backers
- outcome based on spotlight
